Just a meteor app for my homepage. Decided to build a blog for kicks.

Includes a full Meteor app, which gives us React and Mongo out of the box. I've also added Sass for easier CSS writing (I haven't written straight CSS in a looooong time, and have no desire to do so ever again), FontAwesome, 

Fully dockerized!
